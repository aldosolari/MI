The main goal of this course is to expose students to modern ideas in statistical inference, ranging from classical multiple testing to post-selection inference and variable selection procedures for high-dimensional data.

## Homeworks

|| N || Date || Deadline || Text ||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||  || ||  ||  || ||
|| 1 || 27/03/2020 || 06/04/2020 || [HW1](docs/hw/hw1.pdf) ||
|| 2 || 30/03/2020 || 10/04/2020 || [HW2](docs/hw/hw2.pdf) ||
|| 3 || 03/04/2020 || 14/04/2020 || [HW3](docs/hw/hw3.pdf) ||
|| 4 || 07/04/2020 || 21/04/2020 || [HW4]() ||
|| 5 || 17/04/2020 || 21/04/2020 || [HW5]() ||

The rules are the following:

* You will have to submit your solution by the deadline. Feel free to choose the format for your solution (.txt, .tex, .pdf etc.), the nicer the better, and the number of files in attachment (one or more, but not too many)

* Answer with clarity and precision. All R code must be reproducible

* For theoretical questions, try to provide a well-reasoned mathematical argument. Simulations can help form your intuition; but a purely empirical answer will only receive partial points

* It is encouraged to discuss the problem sets with others, but every group needs to turn in a unique write-up. Use of sources (people, books, internet and so on) without citing them in homework sets results in failing grade

* At the end of the homeworks, each member must fill a peer rating form of team members. The individual score will be the team score adjusted based on peer ratings

* All students must follow a code of conduct, which covers issues such as plagiarism, falsification, unauthorized assistance, cheating, and other grievous acts of academic dishonesty

* Name your files HM[N]_[GroupName] where [N] is the homework number and [GroupName] is your group name

* [List of groups](docs/hw/groups.pdf)

## Exam

Two options: 

1. Oral examination 

2. Homeworks and (shorter) oral examination.  

For the homeworks:

  * Students can partecipate in groups (max. 3 persons)  
  
  * There will be 5 homeworks; the lowest score will be dropped in the final grade
  
  * Each homework has a deadline: solutions should be submitted via e-mail (late submissions will *not* be accepted)
