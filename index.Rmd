The aim is to introduce advanced inferential methods, ranging from classical multiple testing to post-selection inference and variable selection procedures for high-dimensional data.

## Program

* The crisis of modern science and selective inference

* The multiple testing problem: methods for familywise error rate and false discovery rate control

* The post-hoc inference problem: simultaneous confidence bounds for the false discovery proportion 

* The variable selection problem: sample-splitting inference, stability selection and knockoffs


## Exam

Oral examination. For attending students, the oral examination may be replaced by a written examination (only for the first two exam sessions).
