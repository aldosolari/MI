The main goal of this course is to expose students to modern ideas in statistical inference, ranging from classical multiple testing to post-selection inference and variable selection procedures for high-dimensional data.

## Exam

Two options: 

1. Oral examination 

2. Homeworks and (shorter) oral examination.  

For the homeworks:

  * Students can partecipate in groups (max. 3 persons)  
  
  * There will be 5 homeworks; the lowest score will be dropped in the final grade
  
  * Each homework has a deadline: solutions should be submitted via e-mail (late submissions will *not* be accepted)

 <!-- For attending students, the oral examination may be replaced by a written examination (only for the first two exam sessions). -->
